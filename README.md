# Python to Javascript Source code Transpiler

So, I have been trying to explore really deep on Compilers, Linters and Programming languages in general, And this project was a fun one to build.
A transpiler takes existing source code's abstract syntax tree, and converts it into a target programming language. In this case I have made use of the 
Python's Abstract Syntax Tree and parse it down to Javascript source code, by using the lexial or grammar rules of Javascript language.
